<p>With the passing of the 125th anniversary of the house in the spring, it has been an important year for our chapter.  The celebration to mark that anniversary was a great event for everyone involved, as brothers from dozens of classes came together to share stories about the house they each experienced and how they have seen it change. Memorabilia from various happenings and years showcased the rich history of Sigma Tau. With the event, the Capital Campaign Committee for house renovations continued to close in on their goal to break ground and restore the full glory of the house, as well as improve it for future members. Helping to maintain the house in the meantime is newly-elected sophomore House Manager Raoul Khouri, whose fantastic efforts during workweek included refinishing front entry and reorganized and cleaning the boiler room.
With thirteen pledges in the current fall pledge class, matching the number of brothers that came in from last yearâ€™s rush, Rush and Social Chair Matthew Lindsay ran a strong rush. Highlights included deep-sea fishing off of Gloucester, MA, and a king crab dinner prepared by chef Dan West, who continues to excel in his role as both chef and mentor to the brothers. Sophomores Michael Delaus and Robert DiSanto will be in charge of the education of these new members, and are continuing the work started before them to revamp and improve the process.</p>

<p>With the graduation or retirement of many members of the Executive Board, elections showed a changing of the guard for the board. Junior Travis Herbanek took charge as President, with classmate Seth Studebaker acting as his Vice President. The two constructed a DKE Sigma Tau Judicial Committee Procedure to ensure all house incidents are handled promptly and fairly. Sophomore Jacob Del Priore headed the effort to separate the duties of the Vice President and create a new position for the house, the Nu (Risk Manager). Elected to this position, Del Priore joins Herbanek, Studebaker, Khouri, Lindsay, House Steward Matthew Iovino, and Treasure Maxwell Ruston on the Executive Board. 
In other news, seniors Seve Esparrago and Brian Copeland were made captains of the MIT football team. Copeland was also named an All-American alongside Joseph Hanley. In intermural news, the house fielded especially strong basketball and soccer teams, with the soccer team winning a Soccer B League Championship against perennial powerhouse MIT Spain. </p>

<p>With a new, younger board and possible renovations on the horizon, the brothers of Sigma Tau are excited for what year 126 has in store.</p>
